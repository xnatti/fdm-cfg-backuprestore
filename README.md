# fdm-cfg-backuprestore

Testing using the API to a FirePower (FDM managed) 6.6 device to download and restore config

## Why am I not using (...)

There are a few reasons.

1. I'm practising, and I'm not there yet, knowledge wise. (classes for example)
2. I want the code to be readable enough so someone that's also just starting out can both understand and modify the code for their own use. (ie, no classes, separate filenames for functions)
